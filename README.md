# October Delight

Yet another baseball fantasy simulation.

## Skill system

Based on a set of 4 Piecepack dice, each of a different color (Black, Red, Green, Blue) and containing faces of Null, Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5. 4 dice are rolled and a total is tallied as such: for Red | Green | Blue dice, an Ace counts as +1 and everything else as 0. For the Black die, an Ace, 3, or 5 counts as +1, and the rest 0.

Here is a probability chart of the possible values:

0: 125
1: 75 + 125 = 200
2: 15 + 75 = 90
3: 1 + 15 = 16
4: 1
